# Solutions to Facebook Hacker Cup 2014 problems

This repository contains solutions to the [Facebook Hacker Cup 2014][1] problems. These solutions are provided "as is". I give no guarantees that they will work as expected.

## Instructions

You can compile all the problems by issuing the following command:

    $ make

If you want to compile only a specific problem, issue the following command, replacing `<problem_id>` with the section and id of the problem you want to compile (see section "Problems Solved" for the list of possible ids):

    $ make <problem_id>

Running a compiled problem is just a matter of executing a command similar to the next one, replacing `<problem_id>` with the id of the desired problem:

    $ ./<problem_id>

Some of the problems have an alternative version written in [Scala][2]. A [sbt][3] launch script that allows users to quickly compile and run Scala source code, without the need to have anything installed other than a standard Java compiler, is provided. You can run any Scala solution by issuing the following command in the repository root directory:

    $ ./sbt run

Unless stated otherwise, every problem in this repository reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output.
